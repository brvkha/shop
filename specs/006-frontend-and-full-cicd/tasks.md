# Tasks: Frontend Application and Full Push-to-Deploy CI/CD

**Input**: Design docs from `/specs/006-frontend-and-full-cicd/`  
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required), `quickstart.md`

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Align repository configuration to the approved deployment/security model before implementation.

**Acceptance Checks**:
- Terraform outputs needed by CI/CD are documented and mapped to GitHub secrets/variables.
- OIDC-only authentication model is reflected in deployment docs (no static AWS access keys).
- Frontend workspace has baseline tooling and environment contracts.

- [X] T001 [P] Create CI/CD variable mapping table from Terraform outputs in specs/006-frontend-and-full-cicd/quickstart.md (Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T002 Replace access-key-based auth guidance with GitHub OIDC role assumption in specs/006-frontend-and-full-cicd/quickstart.md (Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T003 Add/update production environment variable contract for backend/frontend in .github/workflows/ci.yml (Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T004 [P] Confirm frontend environment sample and runtime contract in frontend/.env.example (Owner: Frontend)

---

## Phase 2: CI/CD Scope (User Story 3 - Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Push to `main` executes CI automatically and allows production deployment only after environment approval.

**Independent Test**: Push to `main` runs CI, waits on `production` approval gate, and deploys immutable SHA artifacts for backend/frontend after approval.

**Acceptance Checks**:
- CI runs backend + frontend quality gates on PR and push.
- Deploy workflows use OIDC role assumption and do not require AWS long-lived keys.
- Partial deployment failures mark workflow failed without auto-rollback.

- [X] T005 [US3] Implement backend+frontend CI gate workflow with explicit quality stages in .github/workflows/ci.yml (depends on T003, Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T006 [US3] Enforce OIDC credential step and production environment approval in .github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml (depends on T002, T005, Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T007 [US3] Create frontend deploy workflow (build, S3 sync, CloudFront invalidation) in .github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml (depends on T001, T002, T005, Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T008 [US3] Preserve immutable commit-SHA artifact handling and manual rollback dispatch inputs in .github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml (depends on T006, Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T009 [P] [US3] Add workflow failure summaries and per-target diagnostics in .github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml (depends on T006, Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T010 [P] [US3] Add workflow failure summaries and per-target diagnostics in .github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml (depends on T007, Owner: DevOps)
- [X] T011 [US3] Update deploy scripts to consume Secrets Manager-backed runtime configuration in backend/scripts/deploy-via-ssm.sh (depends on T006, Owner: Backend)

## Phase 3: Frontend Scope (User Story 1 - Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Deliver user-facing web study experience with secure auth, deck/card management, media upload, and study flow.

**Independent Test**: User signs in, performs deck/card CRUD including media upload, completes a study round with rating actions, and sees consistent state updates.

**Acceptance Checks**:
- Auth state and protected routing are enforced.
- Deck/card CRUD and search are usable on mobile width >= 360px.
- Presigned upload validates 5MB max before backend calls.

- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Implement auth pages and session bootstrap in frontend/src/features/auth/ (depends on T004, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T013 [US1] Implement route guards and role-aware redirects in frontend/src/router/guards.tsx (depends on T012, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Implement deck CRUD pages and query hooks in frontend/src/features/decks/ (depends on T012, Owner: Frontend)

- [X] T016 [US1] Implement deck search and in-deck advanced card search in frontend/src/features/search/ (depends on T014, T015, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T017 [US1] Implement S3 presigned media upload flow with 5MB validation in frontend/src/features/media/ (depends on T015, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T018 [US1] Implement study session interaction flow (reveal/rate/progress) in frontend/src/features/study/ (depends on T014, T015, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T019 [US1] Implement account profile and daily-learning-limit settings UI in frontend/src/features/profile/ (depends on T012, Owner: Frontend)

## Phase 4: Frontend Scope (User Story 2 - Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Deliver admin dashboard and moderation operations with strict role boundaries.

**Independent Test**: Admin can view platform stats and moderate users/decks/cards; non-admin users are denied and redirected.

**Acceptance Checks**:
- Admin routes require admin role.
- Ban and moderation actions surface clear confirmation and failure states.
- Non-admin access attempts are safely rejected.

- [X] T020 [P] [US2] Implement admin dashboard stats screen in frontend/src/features/admin/dashboard/ (depends on T013, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T021 [US2] Implement admin user moderation (ban/unban) in frontend/src/features/admin/users/ (depends on T020, Owner: Frontend)
- [X] T022 [US2] Implement admin deck moderation (delete any deck) in frontend/src/features/admin/decks/ (depends on T020, Owner: Frontend)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- Phase 1 (Setup): No dependencies.
- Phase 2 (CI/CD scope): Depends on Phase 1 and unblocks production deployment path.
- Phase 3 (Frontend US1): Depends on Phase 1; can progress in parallel with late CI/CD hardening after T005.
- Phase 4 (Frontend US2): Depends on Phase 3 guard/auth foundations.
- Phase 5 (Validation): Depends on completion of relevant CI/CD + frontend implementation tasks.
- Phase 6 (Docs): Depends on validated behavior from Phases 2-5.

### Task-Level Critical Path

- T001 -> T007 -> T010 -> T030 -> T033 -> T034
- T003 -> T005 -> T006 -> T008 -> T030
- T004 -> T012 -> T013 -> T020 -> T021/T022/T023 -> T024
- T012 -> T014/T015 -> T016/T017/T018 -> T026 -> T027

### Parallel Opportunities

- T001 and T004 can run in parallel during Setup.
- T009 and T010 can run in parallel after deploy workflows are in place.
- T014 and T015 can run in parallel after auth bootstrap.
- T025 and T026 can run in parallel once frontend flows stabilize.

## Suggested MVP Scope

- MVP target: Complete Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + T025/T026/T028 + T031/T033.
- This ships P1 value: user web study experience and governed push-to-deploy path with manual production approval.

## Format Validation

- All tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path`.
- User story labels are applied to story-specific phases (US1, US2, US3).
- Every task includes ownership hint and dependency context where required.
