# Tasks: Core Database and Entity Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-database-entities/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/persistence-contract.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Include unit, integration, and contract tests to satisfy constitutional quality gates for persistence, concurrency, and reliability behavior.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies.
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 and blocks all user stories.
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Depends on Phase 2; delivers MVP persistence foundation.
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Depends on Phase 2; integrates with US1 persistence service but remains independently testable with seeded IDs.
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Depends on Phase 3 because integrity enforcement targets US1 entities and update flows.
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: Depends on completion of selected user stories.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Starts after foundational phase; no dependency on other stories.
- **US2 (P2)**: Starts after foundational phase; optional integration point with US1 commit service.
- **US3 (P3)**: Starts after US1 implementation because it hardens US1 persistence behavior.

### Within Each User Story

- Tests first and failing before implementation.
- Entities/models before services.
- Services before integration wiring.
- Logging and compliance updates before story checkpoint.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US1)

1. Complete Setup and Foundational phases.
2. Deliver US1 relational schema/entities/services.
3. Validate US1 independent test before adding async logging or hardening.

### Incremental Delivery

1. US1 establishes authoritative transactional persistence.
2. US2 adds asynchronous activity logging with retry/dead-letter reliability.
3. US3 adds strict validation and concurrency hardening.
4. Polish phase finalizes observability and compliance evidence.

### Parallel Team Strategy

1. Team completes Phase 1-2 together.
2. One engineer focuses on US1 core entities/migrations.
3. One engineer focuses on US2 async DynamoDB pipeline.
4. One engineer focuses on US3 validation/concurrency test hardening after US1 base merges.

## Notes

- Task format follows strict checklist structure: `- [ ] T### [P] [US#] Description with file path`.
- `[P]` markers are only used where tasks touch separate files with no incomplete dependency.
- All user stories include independent tests and story checkpoints.
- Pagination is intentionally not implemented in this feature because no list API endpoint is in scope.
